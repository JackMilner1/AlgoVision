## Background
AlgoVision is a small tool used for visualising different data structures and algorithms to give the user a better understanding of important computer science topics. This is an educational tool, having simple yet effective graphics that could make an important resource for teaching A-Level, University and beyond in the professional field to learn how these common data structures can be used and visualise their effectiveness.
